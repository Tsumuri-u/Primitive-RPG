# A primitive turn-based RPG
## *Just play Dragon Quest.*

This application is a simple turn-based RPG. Some game mechanics include:
- Encountering monsters
- Choosing attacks
- Fighting battles
- Levelling up

This is a fun little game that you can play to pass the time. I'm interested in learning the code behind
game systems, and want to practice designing such systems.
